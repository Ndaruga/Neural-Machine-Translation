# Neural Machine Translation


In this project, we will build a neural machine translation system using modern techniques for sequence-to-sequence modeling. 
We will first implement a baseline encoder-decoder architecture, then improve upon the baseline by adding an attention mechanism and implementing beam search. 
The end result will be a fully functional translation system capable of <strong>translating simple German sentences into English.</strong>
